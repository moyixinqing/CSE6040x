# CSE 6040/x: Practice Problems for the Final Exam #

We are releasing a collection of practice problems for the Final Exam. Most of them were taken from previous exams, and include almost all problems ever given in this class. These should be available in edX (online students) or Canvas (on-campus students) starting Thursday, November 12.

> If you post Piazza questions about these problems, please use the naming convention `pf.xx.yy` for Practice Final, Problem `xx`, Exercise `yy`, and tag your post with the `practice_final`. That will help you find relevant posts and will help your peers and us triage.

One caveat is that the exam format has changed over time. For example, in Spring 2020, there were two problems worth 15 points total (5 points for one, 10 points for the other), with a total time of 4 hours to work on them; however, to earn "full credit" (100%) a student only needed to get 10 points. (We announce the point threshold _before_ the exam begins. Earned points beyond that threshold do _not_ count as extra credit, but feel free to do it "for the glory.")

The Spring 2020 exam corresponds to Problems 19 and 20 in the collection. The Fall 2020 exam will mimic the Spring 2020 format and style. However, the exact time limit (between 3-4 hours) and the "100%-threshold" will depend on how hard we believe the problems are based on our internal staff testing. All other problems are there to help you assess your coverage of the material. Most other logistical details about the Final Exam are identical to Midterm 2.

Twenty-one practice problems is a lot! So, to help you prioritize, here is what we think you should focus on.

## Suggested problems ##

From Spring 2020 -- these will most closely resemble the Fall 2020 problems in format and style of test code. So at a minimum, try to do these.
- Problem 19 ("Click-through balancing act" — basic Python, pandas, and Numpy)
- Problem 20 ("Topic sentence extraction" — SVD, Numpy, Python strings)

From Fall 2020 -- similar to the above
- Problem 17 (“Partitioning political blogs” — basic pandas + math to Numpy)
- Problem 18 (“Data jobs” — general Python + pandas)

The following problems are from earlier years, and are representative of the content you are expected to know. However, the expected time to solve these problems might be differ from the above because the time limits were different. (Also, the style of test code was less robust.)
- Problem 2 (“But her emails…” — SQL/pandas)
- Problem 4 (“DBSCAN” for clustering)
- Problem 8 (“triangle counting” — Numpy)
- Problem 12 (“snowball poem generator” — basic Python, strings)
- Problem 13 (“traveling salesperson” — basic Python)
- Problem 15 (“Semi-supervised learning” — math to Numpy)

## Additional problems ##

The remaining problems are interesting, but in terms of what they cover, they largely duplicate the content of the problems listed above. Therefore, you can probably skip them unless you feel you need more practice.

- Problem 6 (“SQL parser” — string+regex)
- Problem 7 (“Olympics search trends” — SQL/pandas)
- Problem 5 (“JSON” — has one possibly tricky element)
- Problem 9 (“Board game similarity” — Numpy)
- Problem 11 (“Text preprocessing for ML” — strings, basic Python)
- Problem 14 (“Gaussian mixtures” — math to Numpy)
